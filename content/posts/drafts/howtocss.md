How to become self-reliant with writing CSS
Changing the way a Mendix app looks is done through CSS. Changing an apps look & feel can not only improve the visual experience, but also improve the UX by positioning and styling elements in a logical way. When a company has a specific house style, CSS is vital in changing the app's element to adhere to the company designs. 

Unfortunately, I still speak to many Mendix developers who just *don't get it*. Even some experienced Mendix developers with a decade of experience somehow always stayed away from styling and CSS. When I speak with them, I always hear the same thing: they just don't know where to start. 

Which is regrettable, because styling is in my opinion one of the most satisfying parts of app development.
