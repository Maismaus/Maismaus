*Here's the deal* â€“ you're 20-something years old, freshly graduated off college. Maybe you've flirted with coding in the past, hacked your way through a few websites and generally have affinity with modern technology. Or perhaps you are a psychology student and enjoyed working with statistics. You're starting to realise that your minor in theatre studies is not going to pay your bills. **You'll need to find yourself one of them jobs.**

Before I started working as a Mendix developer I had serious doubts about my future career path. I liked writing code, but I didn't see myself doing that all day, every day. But I did like building things. I like looking back at a days' work and seeing the results. That's what building software is. I didn't know about low code until I was approached by my previous employer, Finaps, where they explained the Mendix platform to me.

As a Mendix developer you build applications without writing traditional code. Instead, you're building applications using prebuilt parts. You design pieces of logic called microflows, which Mendix translates into things computers can understand when you launch the application. A microflow looks like a traditional workflow diagram. It has a start and an end, and executes the pieces of logic in between.

*A traditional microflow that retrieves an object from the database, changes it and returns it to the database.*

Because the pieces are prebuilt and ready to use, you can develop logic up to ten times faster than traditional coding methods. And because the learning curve is much less steep than coding, it's a lot easier to get into. You don't need a computer science degree to start working with low code technologies. In fact, most Mendix developers come from completely different academic fields. I've had the pleasure of working with Mendix developers with diverse academic backgrounds such as biomedical science, psychology and industrial engineering. And while IT sector continues to be a [male-dominated world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_disparity_in_computing), this stereotype doesn't hold up as much in low code. Women even outnumbered the men in my team at some point. 

This diversity in backgrounds leads to low code developers often taking on more diverse responsibilities. It is no coincidence that low code developers are often referred to as business engineers, although I still prefer to refer to us as developers. The term business engineer is a a combination of business administration expert and software engineer, indicating that business engineers form a hybrid between the two. Most of your day is usually spent developing, but you can be involved in many more parts of the software development process. At Finaps, it was no exception that business engineers were involved in other activities such as sales, user experience design and requirement gathering. 

That means you have a lot of options for career growth. You could start as a simple developer but later choose to expand into other territories. If you find that you have a knack for selling the platform, you can do that besides your main gig. If you feel comfortable designing applications before building them, there's usually an opening to do so. Traditional software engineers don't often get this luxury. 

A lot of that also comes down to companies supporting that flexibility. Most companies active in low code are great places to work. They have to be, in order to attract and retain the right people. If you haven't noticed, low code is booming and so are job openings. Companies have to work really hard to find new business engineers and they want to keep employees happy and satisfied. It also means that if you choose to work in low code, you'll be almost certain of having a job for the next decade or so. And while something like job security sounds like the dullest topic to talk about at first, the feeling that you can find a job anywhere is truly comforting. 

Most of my experience comes from my time at [Finaps](https://www.finaps.nl/), but I think most of this applies to other companies as well. The freedom and growth opportunities that you get are great. And you can even decide to grow into freelancing, as I recently  [did](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6851808905958346752?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BwtjbeyO4ROecTjEpolP23g%3D%3D). Whatever you decide, as a Mendix developer you'll always have the satisfaction of building amazing digital applications with real world impact.
