*Here's the deal* â€“ you're 20-something years old, freshly graduated off college. Maybe you've flirted with coding in the past, hacked your way through a few websites and generally have affinity with modern technology. Or perhaps you are a psychology student and enjoyed working with statistics. You're starting to realise that your minor in theatre studies is not going to pay your bills. **You'll need to find yourself one of them jobs.**

Then comes the question of *what in the hell am I going to do for a living?* Writing code might be great but you don't see yourself doing that *all day long for the next forty years of your life*, right? Or staring at Excel sheets all day? Those were my thoughts before I started working in low code, when I was approached with an offer to work as a business engineer.

People who work in low code development are often referred to as business engineers. The term business engineer is a combination of software engineer and business administration expert. Business engineers know how businesses operate and are able to understand complex organisations. They can translate organization needs into software requirements. But after doing so, they are also able to produce software out of these requirements using a low code development platform. 

For you as a business engineer, this means a lot of variation in your day to day work. You are often involved in many more steps of the software development process than traditional software engineers. You might spend the morning generating ideas in meetings with business stakeholders, and implementing those same ideas in the afternoon. At the end of the day, you'll have the satisfaction of having produced a completely new piece of software.

And that piece of software could be a customer-facing webpage, or a complex integration part. Low-code platforms contain all necessary pieces to create complete software packages with. You don't have to constrain yourself to being a front-end developer or back-end developer as software engineers often do, although you can specialize in some area.

Traditionally, programmers are stereotyped as the nerdy, big-glasses guy behind a desk in the basement of a big office building. While I believe that image is shifting, part of the stereotype still holds up. The IT sector continues to be a male-dominated world, with men outnumbering women by [no small margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_disparity_in_computing). With business engineers, that stereotype doesn't hold up. I've had the pleasure of working with business engineers from completely different academic fields including biomedical science, psychology and industrial engineering. At some point, women even outnumbered the men in the team. 

Companies are usually great places to work for, too. They have to be, in order to attract and retain the right people. While working as a business engineer, you'll usually enjoy a lot of freedom in companies that greatly value their employees and show it. Or you could decide to be your own boss and work as a freelancer, as I recently [did](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6851808905958346752?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BwtjbeyO4ROecTjEpolP23g%3D%3D). Since experienced business engineers are highly sought after, you'll enjoy knowing that you can probably find a job anywhere, anytime. 

So, there you have it. While working as a business engineer, you can enjoy working on technical problems while actively interacting with your client during the process of building amazing apps. You'll meet wonderful people from a variety of academic backgrounds,
