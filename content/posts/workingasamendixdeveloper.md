*Here's the deal* â€“ you're 20-something years old, freshly graduated off college. Maybe you've flirted with coding in the past, hacked your way through a few websites and generally have affinity with modern technology. Or perhaps you are a psychology student and enjoyed working with statistics. You're starting to realise that your minor in theatre studies is not going to pay your bills. **You'll need to find yourself one of them jobs.**

Before I started working as a Mendix developer I had serious doubts about my future career path. I liked writing code, but I didn't see myself doing that all day, every day. But I did like building things. I like looking back at a days' work and seeing the results. That's what building software is. I didn't know about low code until I was approached by my previous employer who explained the Mendix platform to me.

As a Mendix developer you build digital applications without writing traditional code. Instead, you're building applications using prebuilt parts. You design pieces of logic called microflows, which Mendix translates into things computers can understand once you launch the application. A microflow looks like a traditional workflow diagram. It has a start and an end, and executes the pieces of logic in between.

*A traditional microflow that retrieves an object from the database, does something with it, and returns it to the database.*

Because the pieces are prebuilt and ready to use, you can develop logic up to ten times faster than traditional coding methods. And because the learning curve is much less steep than coding, it's a lot easier to get into. You don't need a computer science degree to start working with low code technologies. In fact, most Mendix developers come from completely different academic fields. I've had the pleasure of working with Mendix developers with diverse academic backgrounds such as biomedical science, psychology and industrial engineering. And while the IT sector continues to be a [male-dominated world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_disparity_in_computing), this stereotype doesn't hold up as much in low code. Women even outnumbered the men in my team at some point.

This diversity in backgrounds leads to low code developers often taking on more diverse responsibilities. It is no coincidence that low code developers are often referred to as business engineers, although I still prefer to refer to us as developers. A business engineer forms a hybrid between a business administration expert and software engineer. It means they can understand and translate business needs into software requirements, but also transform those requirements into actual software. Most of your day is usually spent developing, but you can be involved in many more parts of the software development process. At my previous employer, it was no exception that business engineers were involved in other activities such as sales and user experience (UX) design.

That means you have a lot of options for career growth. You could start as a simple developer but later choose to expand into other territories. If you find that you have a knack for selling the platform, you can do that alongside your main gig. If you feel comfortable designing applications before building them, there's usually an opening to do so. Traditional software engineers don't often get this luxury.

A lot of that also comes down to companies supporting that flexibility. Most companies active in low code are great places to work. They have to be, in order to attract and retain the right people. If you haven't noticed, low code is booming and so are job openings. Finding new business engineers is challenging and companies want to keep employees happy and satisfied. It also means that if you choose to work in low code, you'll be almost certain of having a job for the next decade or so. And while something like job security sounds like the dullest topic to talk about at first, the feeling that you can find a job anywhere is truly comforting.

If you want to work as a Mendix developer you have a number of options. If you choose to work in consultancy, you'll have the opportunity to work on projects for different companies. It's a great way to explore diverse professional environments. In the past four years, I  worked for companies of all shapes and sizes in fields such as finance, insurance, health and government. If you are unsure what you want for your career, working in consultancy is the perfect way to explore your options.
Alternatively, you can choose to work for a company which uses the Mendix applications directly. Or you can choose to apply for a job at Mendix itself. As I don't have hands-on experience with either, I don't feel qualified to talk about those options, but I've heard positive stories about both.

The freedom and growth opportunities that you get as a Mendix developer are great. And you can even decide to move into freelancing, as I recently  [did](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6851808905958346752?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BwtjbeyO4ROecTjEpolP23g%3D%3D). Whatever you decide, as a Mendix developer you'll always have the satisfaction of building amazing digital applications with real world impact.
